# Jet Tagging with CERN Open Data

Welcome to the **Jet Tagging** repository! This project utilizes CERN Open Data to develop machine learning models for identifying and classifying jets from high-energy particle collisions. It's an excellent resource for researchers, students, and enthusiasts in particle physics and data science.

## Features

- **Data Processing:** Ingest and preprocess raw data from CERN Open Data.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement and train models like neural networks and decision trees for jet classification.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Understand jet characteristics through comprehensive data analysis.
- **Evaluation Tools:** Assess model performance with various metrics and visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, etc.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adrita-Khan/Jet-Tagging/.git
   cd jet-tagging
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Data:**
   Visit the [CERN Open Data Portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/) to obtain the necessary jet datasets and place them in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Explore and run `notebooks/jet_tagging_analysis.ipynb` for guided analysis and model training.
- **Scripts:** Execute training scripts directly:
  ```bash
  python src/train_model.py --config configs/config.yaml
  ```
